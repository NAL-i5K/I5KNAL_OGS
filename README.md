# I5KNAL_OGS
This project is to develop python tools for generating official gene set (OGS) by integrating manually curated and predicted gene annotations. There are two phases involved: (1) QC phase and (2) Merge phase. A prototype of the whole pipeline has been done by I5K Workspace@NAL team. However, the source codes of the prototype program is not release for public, because it incorporated several components written by programming languages other than Python. Therefore, this project will re-implement those non-python components, and expects to deliver a complete python package for OGS generation. If you have urgent needs for OGS generation, you can send queries to I5K [at] ars.usda.gov. The i5k team can help to host your data, and apply OGS generation pipeline on your data for you.
